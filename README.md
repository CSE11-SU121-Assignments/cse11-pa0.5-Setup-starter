# CSE-11 Programming Assignment 0.5
### Due Date: Thursday, July 1, 11:59PM Pacific Time
## Learning Goals
- Set up and test your Java development environment

## Process
- General instructions for setting up your environment can be found in [this](https://github.com/CSE11-SU121-Assignments/cse11-pa0.5-Setup-starter/blob/main/Instructions%20for%20setting%20up%20Java%20on%20your%20own%20machine.pdf) document, and as video tutorials for [Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FxIAaGj7JAAN5QNpqcx1JBdv36yzX6TX/view?usp=sharing)  and [Mac](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EsF6t_ZA7TIdQ0iIu9X_dh1T5YGmzxNG/view?usp=sharing). Instructions for accessing CloudLabs can be found [here](https://github.com/CSE11-SU121-Assignments/cse11-sp21-pa0.5-Setup-starter/blob/main/CloudLabs%20Instructions.pdf).
- If you get stuck at any point, do any one of the following:
    - Take a screenshot and ask on Piazza! (Not sure how to take a screenshot? Try Googling it for your particular platform, like “screenshot microsoft windows” or “screenshot chromebook” or “screenshot os x”, or ask how on Piazza and we can help.)
    - Join a 1-on-1 or group [help session](https://ucsd-cse11-su121.github.io/#staff)!
    
- If you get stuck, can't get help, and can't finish, write up a description of what you tried and why you couldn't finish! We'll give you credit for that, too, and it will help us understand how to help you get set up.

## Submission
- Your submission will be in the form of a PDF writeup. You can find a template for the writeup [here](https://github.com/CSE11-SU121-Assignments/cse11-pa0.5-Setup-starter/blob/main/PA0.5%20Submission%20Template.pdf).
- Please submit your writeup to the [PA0.5 gradescope assignment](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/277487/assignments/1360355/submissions).

## Setup (4.5 points)
Follow the instructions in the video tutorial for your chosen environment (Windows, Mac, or CloudLabs) to set up your environment for writing code in Java. You can also use this document for your reference. Write a few sentences describing which environment you will be using, and the steps you took to set it up. Note that you're free to use another environment if you like, we just don't have tutorials for other environments.

## Running Code (4.5 points)

Create a new directory named pa05. Create a new file in pa05 named:
`IntroductionTo.java`
Put the following code into that file (you can copy-paste):
```
class IntroductionTo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Welcome to CSE 11");
	}
}
```
Compile and run your program. You can find instructions for "Editing Your Java Code" and "Running Your Java Code" [here](https://github.com/CSE11-SU121-Assignments/cse11-pa0.5-Setup-starter/blob/main/Instructions%20for%20setting%20up%20Java%20on%20your%20own%20machine.pdf). Instructions are also included in the setup video tutorials for [Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FxIAaGj7JAAN5QNpqcx1JBdv36yzX6TX/view?usp=sharing) and [Mac](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EsF6t_ZA7TIdQ0iIu9X_dh1T5YGmzxNG/view?usp=sharing). Finally, take a screenshot of your terminal (including the commands you ran to compile and run the code) and include it in your [writeup](https://github.com/CSE11-SU121-Assignments/cse11-pa0.5-Setup-starter/blob/main/PA0.5%20Submission%20Template.pdf).
